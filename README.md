# Udacity_da_EDA_police_shootings_R

This project is part of the Udacity Degree Data Analyst and is supposed to showcase explorative data analysis (EDA) with R. Since I was allowed to use any dataset I decided against using any of the (to my mind rather boring) options provided by Udacity but instead chose to take a closer look at police shootings in the USA.
